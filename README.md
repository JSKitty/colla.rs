# Colla.rs
The Colla.rs client; because Rust safety applies to sex toys too, right? right..?

## Server Implementation
The Colla.rs server (in which this client is designed for) has it's own independent repository [here](https://github.com/JSKitty/colla.rs-server), go check it out!

## Dev Installation
First off, you'll want **Rust**, **Node/NPM** and **Tauri** installed.

- Clone this repo
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm run tauri dev`
- Let the magic happen!
- To compile into release-optimised binaries, run `npm run tauri build`
